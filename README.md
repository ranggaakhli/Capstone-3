**City Contextual Background**

Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, showcases impressive economic resilience despite ongoing demographic shifts. Supported by robust industries like textiles, metals, and machinery, Daegu reported a substantial regional GDP of $44,144 million in 2021, cementing its pivotal role in South Korea's economic landscape. This economic vitality not only sustains local businesses but also propels a dynamic real estate market ripe with strategic growth opportunities.

Key to Daegu's economic strategy is its designation as a Free Economic Zone (FEZ) since 2008, attracting over US$751 million in foreign investments and offering significant tax incentives and regulatory advantages. This status has transformed Daegu into a magnet for diverse industries, fostering substantial industrial growth and creating over 22,000 new jobs. The FEZ's influence extends beyond economic indicators, shaping Daegu's real estate dynamics by fostering an environment conducive to both residential and commercial development.

Daegu's appeal extends beyond economic factors to its diverse population, which includes immigrant workers from South and Southeast Asia contributing to its industrial workforce and cultural tapestry. Additionally, the presence of US military personnel and their families stationed at bases such as Camp Henry and Camp Walker adds a unique dynamic to the city's residential landscape.

Recognizing an opportunity within Daegu's vibrant real estate market, the startup XXX aims to provide invaluable insights. Using advanced machine learning and predictive analytics, the company plans to analyze extensive datasets encompassing historical sales and other features related to price prediction.

By offering precise insights, the startup XXX aims to empower users with informed decisions when purchasing or renting apartments in Daegu. This initiative seeks to optimize investment strategies, ensuring competitive pricing and leveraging Daegu's affordability and cultural amenities.

Through this initiative, the startup endeavors to enhance transparency and efficiency in apartment transactions, thereby contributing to the vibrancy and sustainability of Daegu's real estate market.
